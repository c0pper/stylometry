se adoptó ¡acuerdos vía votación ilegítima sin previo debate! que el reglamento del congreso exige (artículo 64°) pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento por estar previstos en norma especiales atinentes precisamente la elección de los miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva que le compete al congreso tal como lo prevé el artículo 86° de nuestra carta política fundamentos de hecho jurídicos 1 derecho contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente el artículo 86° de la constitución política se ocupa expresamente de la elección por el congreso de tres (3) miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva por lo tanto los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección elección sea minuciosa ponderada responsable legítima contando con los elementos de juicio del caso se elige ciegas por consignas inalámbricas sin verle la cara al elegido sin escucharlo sin examinar quién e como en realidad se hizo ¡se violó pues con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional! como quiera que la propia constitución política consigna otros ingredientes de tal elección ella misma se remite que sea el reglamento del congreso el que la desarrolle de eso se ocupa el artículo 94° de la misma carta política cuando establece “el congreso elabora aprueba su reglamento que tiene fuerza de ley” con este reglamento el congreso opera actúa funciona discreción de la presidenta pero aún de una persona particular como keiko fujimori con tal sentido propósito el aludido vigente reglamento del congreso trata expresamente de la elección de esos tres directores en un llamado “procedimiento parlamentario especial” el mismo que ha sido burlado transgredido violado pese su asidero constitucional su indiscutido rango legal veamos lo que establece su artículo 64° inciso c del “procedimiento especial” como uno de los 3 “procedimientos parlamentarios” “los procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del congreso destinados producir leyes resoluciones legislativas actos de control político designaciones nombramientos pueden ser procedimiento legislativo que comprende el debate aprobación de leyes ordinarias leyes orgánicas leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada leyes presupuestales financieras leyes de demarcación territorial leyes de reforma de la constitución política del reglamento del congreso de resoluciones legislativas b procedimientos del control político que comprende la investidura del consejo de ministros la interpelación los ministros la invitación los ministros para que informen la preguntas los ministros la solicitud de información los ministros la administración en general la censura la extensión de confianza los ministros la investigación sobre cualquier asunto de interés público la dación de cuenta el antejuicio político c procedimientos especiales que comprende la designación del contralor la elección del defensor del pueblo de los miembros del tribunal constitucional de 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva así como la ratificación del presidente de dicho banco del superintendente de banca seguros” (artículo modificado aprobado por el pleno del congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998) en consecuencia el “procedimiento especial” donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión vulneró violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este artículo 64° del reglamento del congreso aplicable aquél respecto de todo “procedimiento parlamentario” que e definido como el “conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del congreso destinados producirresoluciones legislativas actos de control político designaciones nombramientos” lo real apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección ¡no hubo debate alguno! por lo que se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron escogieron quienes tenían una “reconocida solvencia moral” quizá “amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas” ¡todo fue un remedo! como se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27102016 ¡no se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario! sino en uno trucado ¡sin promover el debate! además ¡sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate! por lo tanto solo se transgredió el artículo 86° de la constitución política sino también la primera parte además el inciso c del artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso de expreso fundamento constitucional con lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda de la que formo parte resultó agraviada en su derecho contar con funcionarios del banco central de reserva constitucional legal reglamentariamente elegidos ¡por ende los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos josé chlimper ackerman rafael rey rey elmer rafael cuba bustinza frente una proposición de keiko fujimori con fraude procesal son ilegítimos! 2 derecho al voto congresal válido con apego constitución política ley orgánica del banco central de reserva reglamento del congreso como se sabe la elección de los 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva fue por 84 votos la de elmer cuba por 72 la de josé chlimper por 71 la de rafael rey ningún guarismo de esa votación puede considerarse válido legítimo porque ninguno de los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado distribuido cada uno de los parlamentarios examinada como fundamento de su voto la propia misteriosa proposición de candidaturas por keiko fujimori sabemos que apareja ningún documento de los candidatos pese que la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva en su artículo 11° exige como requisitos de los que aspiren ser miembros del directorio del banco tener “reconocida solvencia moral” una “amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas” se trata de elementos real de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí para analizar contrastar evaluar decidir su voto con apego derecho sin falsear su decisión través del voto informado por intereses vitandos que agreden al país reza el violado desacatado al votar inválidamente artículo 11° de la citada ley orgánica “ los directores deben ser peruanos tener reconocida solvencia moral poseer amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas representan entidad interés particular alguno su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad la funciones del banco” si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron dentro del llevado cabo “procedimiento especial parlamentario” al que hemos ante glosado ningún documento de los 3 propuestos 2 por keiko otro dizque por el apra ni hubo debate alguno –el cual se obvió adrede respecto de sus calidades personales profesionales el voto que emitieron fue ciego inducido por el mentado fraude sin deliberación mental alguna al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos real sobre esa “reconocida solvencia moral” la necesaria “amplia competencia” además la “amplia experiencia” que deben favorecer cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio válidamente emitido ¡si los hechosrequisitos su prueba concomitante están ante sí del congresista votante su voto resulta viciado por ende ilegítimo nulo! 3 derecho la transparencia de los actos del estado que garantice el acceso la información pública todo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elección de estos 3 directores del bcrp fue transparente todo fue turbio de principio fin con un clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada keiko fujimori tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por keiko fujimori el día 26102016 un día ante de la elección sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue ante una junta de portavoces que recibió ni vio los currículum vitae de los propuestos así como la aluvional votación llevada cabo el día siguiente el jueves 27102016 sin examinar ningún documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige los candidatos sin el debate que el artículo 64° del reglamento del congreso requiere para esta elección específica en un procedimiento parlamentario especial en relación la calidades personales profesionales de los 3 futuros miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar los actos del estado como éste del congreso que prevé regula la ley 27806 ley de transparencia fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso la información que consagra el numeral 5 del artículo 2 de la constitución política cuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión son transparentes como en efecto lo han sido el derecho fundamental la información pública resulta vulnerado lo cual debe ser reparado ¿fue la bravura de una bravísima keiko su audacia un interés nefando que la llevó proponer con fraude miembros del bcrp? ¡por lo menos se sabe que fue keiko fujimori quien propuso ¿oralmente por escrito? su secretario general de su partido político josé chlimper su ocasional asesor elmer cuba como directores del bcrp ambo activistas de su campaña electoral presidencial última ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chistó rechistó ni hizo amago de mueca alguna todos doblegaron la cerviz designaron de un día otro mediante su voto los propuestos sin trámite ni debate alguno ciegamente sin examen de requisitos legales sin tener la vista semejantes candidatos ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitada!

benny morris’s untenable denial ethnic cleansing palestine reference debate started daniel blatman israeli historian head institute contemporary jewry hebrew university jerusalem penned oped israeli daily haaretz stating ethnic cleansing “is exactly happened 1948” support blatman cited benny morris israeli historian blatman wrote “determined arab country 400000 encouraged leave expelled first stage war—even arab nations’ army invaded” [2] benny morris october 30 2007 ( aude cc bysa 20 ) prompted response morris wrote oped titled “israel conducted ethnic cleansing 1948” contends blatman “distorts history say new state israel country facing invading army carried policy expelling local arabs” blatman “betrayed profession” morris charged “when attributed thing never claimed distorted event 1948 war” central morris’s argument “blatman ignores basic fact palestinian one started war rejected un compromise plan embarked hostile act 1800 jew killed november 1947 midmay 1948” moreover neighboring arab state “threatened invade even un resolution passed november 29 1947 single arab uprooted home” even prior adoption general assembly resolution 181 recommended partitioning palestine separate arab jewish state arab state continuously declared intent “to attack jewish state british left” acknowledges prior zionists’ declaration existence israel may 14 1948 subsequent introduction arab states’ regular army conflict hundred thousand arab (though number “apparently smaller” figure 400000 cited blatman) “were expelled home forced flee” true one hand hundred thousand palestinian forced home never allowed return yet also true ethnic cleansing? morris attempt reconcile apparent contradiction arguing “at stage 1948 war decision leadership yishuv [the jewish community] state ‘expel arabs’” word it’s true many arab indeed expelled result official policy zionist leadership “it’s true 1930s early ‘40s” morris acknowledges “david bengurion chaim weizmann supported transfer arab area future jewish state later supported un decision whose plan left 400000 arab place “it’s also true certain point war bengurion let officer understand preferable arab possible remain new country never gave order ‘to expel arabs’” true “atmosphere transfer prevailed country beginning april 1948” “was never translated official policy—which officer expelled arab others didn’t neither group reprimanded punished “in end 1948 160000 arab remained israeli territory—a fifth population” furthermore “on march 24 1948 israel galili bengurion’s deputy future defense ministry head haganah ordered haganah brigade uproot arab territory designated jewish state thing change early april due yishuv’s shaky condition impending arab invasion overall expulsion policy—here expelled people didn’t part arab simply fled” morris acknowledges zionist leadership mid1948 “adopted policy preventing return refugees” asserts “logical just” ground “same refugee month week earlier tried destroy state making” happened 1948 fit definition “ethnic cleansing” morris concludes arab state hand “carried ethnic cleansing uprooted jew last one territory captured 1948” jew “left arab place haifa jaffa” among place [3] arab leaving haifa jewish force enter city ( public domain ) wasn’t end discussion blatman responded turn oped titled “yes benny morris israel perpetrate ethnic cleansing 1948” writes “on march 10 1948 national haganah headquarters approved plan dalet discussed intention expelling many arab possible territory future jewish state” regard morris’s denial occurred fit definition “ethnic cleansing” blatman quote prosecutor trial radovan karadzic bosnianserb leader convicted ethnic cleansing muslim bosnia ethnic cleansing act way given territory member given ethnic group eliminated massacre everybody massacred massacre order scare population naturally people driven away afraid course end people simply want leave driven away either initiative deported woman raped furthermore often time destruction monument marked presence given population instance catholic church mosque destroyed word contrary morris’s argument doesn’t follow since document zionist leadership explicitly outlined plan expel arab military commander instructed therefore occurred ethnic cleansing prosecutor describes exactly happened 1948 blatman note “implied instruction silent understanding sowing fear among population whose flight objective destruction physical presence left behind” blatman quote morris’s book birth palestinian refugee problem 1947–1949 attack haganah israel defense force expulsion order fear attack act cruelty part jew absence assistance arab world arab higher committee sense helplessness abandonment order arab institution commander leave evacuate case direct decisive reason flight—an attack haganah irgun lehi idf inhabitants’ fear attack blatman add “the expulsion war crime say morris arab started war word hundred thousand innocent civilian belong side began fighting expelled maybe morris would agree genocide carried german herero 1904–1908 justified since herero began rebellion german colonialism namibia” [4] next weigh debate steven klein haaretz editor adjunct professor tel aviv university’s international program conflict resolution mediation klein note morris 1988 essay titled “the new historiography” explained plan zionist force “cleared various area completely arab villages” “jewish atrocity drive avenge past misdeed also contributed significantly exodus” palestinian woman child (source haniniorg cc 30 ) book righteous victim history zionistarab conflict 1881–2001 “morris observed bengurion’s view ‘transfer legitimate solution arab problem’ change publicly declared support forced expulsion 1930s ‘he aware need tactical reason discreet’ thus seemed explained bengurion could responsible expulsion many 700000 palestinian arab without ever issuing order effect” 2004 haaretz interview journalist ari shavit morris said “a jewish state would come without uprooting 700000 palestinian therefore necessary uproot them” “morris course welcome change political view” klein continues “but like historian must understand left paper trail tell substantially different narrative one advocate benny morris 2016 seems accused ‘old historians’ doing—interpreting history downplaying israeli misdeed order defend israel’s legitimacy” [5] next chime debate ehud eingil point haaretz oped among arab allowed remain “15000 druze allied israel 34000 christian israel treated decently anger western ally bedouin muslim village whose leader allied israel jewish neighbor “of 75000 muslim remained (less 15 percent prewar number) ten thousand internally displaced—people fled village expelled allowed return home day” “morris right” eingil continues “when mention ‘atmosphere transfer’ gripped israel april 1948 errs claim atmosphere never translated official policy” quote order given commander plan either destroy village encircle mount “searchandcontrol operations” within event resistance expel inhabitant [6] finally morris responded critic haaretz article titled “‘ethnic cleansing’ proarab propaganda” characterizes article reflecting “a serious way writing history” “opinions history 1948 haven’t changed all” morris asserts maintains “some palestinian expelled (from lod ramle example) ordered encouraged leader flee (from haifa example) fled fear hostility apparently belief would return home expected arab victory “and indeed beginning june new israeli government adopted policy preventing return refugees—those palestinian fought yishuv prestate jewish community tried destroy it” morris contends “in 1947–1948 priori intention expel arab war policy expulsion clearly israelhating ‘historians’ like ilan pappe

greater responsibility war made example morris tends portray jewish violence arab always preceded arab violence jews—even though illustrated equally true arab violence turn preceded jewish violence elsewhere contrast characterizes arab violence morris describes unambiguous war crime committed zionist force merely “mistakes” included among haganah’s “mistakes” attack december 18 1947 village khisas carried approval yigal allon commander palmach (an elite unit within jewish army) zionist force invaded village indiscriminately murdered seven men woman four child morris describes “reprisal” murder jewish cart driver earlier day even though superfluously note “none dead appear involved death cart driver” [21] another haganah’s “mistakes” occurred night january 5 1948 zionist force entered

december 1947–march 1948 accurately directed either perpetrator home bases”—meaning arab village lived thus according morris’s criterion haganah attacked arab village happened home one combatant proceeded go “accurately” killing innocent civilian destroying home mean “mistake” instructively morris quote document intelligence wing haganah consequence describes “jewish reprisals” occurred month “the main effect operation arab civilian population ” (emphasis added) haganah noted including “the destruction houses” psychological trauma among consequence “the jewish attack forced arab tie great

indeed morris go considerable detail documenting summation “the yishuv organized war arab hadn’t” [24] morris’s characterization arab always aggressor jew defensive despite occasional “mistakes” noted extends well prior onset 1948 war lehi’s murder five member shubaki family november 20 seems fit morris’s criterion “mistake” could turn also point arab attack jew occurred well prior incident writes
